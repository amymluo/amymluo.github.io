        <p> Hungry College Student is a falling objects game that chronicles the poor life decisions of my friend John.
            The goal of this game is the catch and eat all of the falling junk food while avoiding the vegetables.
            This game was created in Processing for my Programming Basics class. The full game below has been translated
            into Javascript using p5.js for web compatibility.</p>

        <p> View the source code on my
            <a style="color: dodgerblue;" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/amymluo/hungry-college-student">Github</a>.
        </p>

        <div id="sketch-holder" style="width: 500px;"></div>

        <p> For this game, I wanted to create something reminiscent of the simple, 2D flash games I played when I was
            younger on sites like Neopets and AddictingGames. I also think Processing lends itself very well this style
            of game because of it's ability to easily render shapes and animations with user input.</p>

        <p> My previous experience with Java was very useful in the development of this game. I was able to take
            advantage
            of the object-oriented nature of Java by representing the player, food, and game state as classes. This
            allowed
            me to handle the creation of food and collision in a more streamlined way. </p>

        <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%">
            <img class="hcsIcon projectImg" src="hcs/images/hamburger.png" alt="Hamburger">
            <img class="hcsIcon projectImg" src="hcs/images/kale.png" alt="Kale">

            <img class="hcsIcon projectImg" src="hcs/images/pizza.png" alt="Pizza">
        </div>

        <p> As for the graphics, I wanted the theme of the game to be personal and relatable to my life. One of the
            first things I thought of was how college students are almost always hungry. My friend John and I also joke about
            his bad eating habits. Therefore, the theme I went was for in Hungry College Student was feeding John junk
            food and avoiding vegetables. Originally I wanted the junk food to be the specific foods that John would only eat,
            chicken tenders, buffalo blasters, and Frappuccinos, however I found that these foods didn't come across
            as clearly in a simple graphic, so I chose to go with more identifiable foods. </p>

        <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <img class="hcsIcon projectImg" src="hcs/hcs_sketch.png" width="40%" alt="Player sketches">
            <img class="hcsIcon projectImg" src="hcs/images/john.png" alt="John">
            <img class="hcsIcon projectImg" src="hcs/images/power%20john.png" alt="Super John">
        </div>

        <p> All of the images were created in Adobe Illustrator for an
            overall colorful, flat, graphic aesthetic. For the player sprite, I wanted something very simple, made of a
            few shapes, but still very expressive. After creating some sketches, I decided on just a head sprite with
            an open mouth and sparkle eyes.</p>

        <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
            <img class="breadImg projectImg" src="hcs/kitchen%20muted.png" alt="Kitchen draft colors"
                 style="float: left;">
            <img class="breadImg projectImg" src="hcs/images/kitchen.png" alt="Kitchen Final" style="float: right;">
        </div>

        <p> For the background, I originally went for a more muted, realistic color scheme that could be a believable
            kitchen. However, I felt like this didn't really fit the tone of the game, so I changed the color scheme for
            something more colorful and cartoon-like. Also, to further the theme I added more elements of a messy kitchen,
            which is probably more accurate for a college student. </p>
