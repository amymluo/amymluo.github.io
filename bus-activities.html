        <p>This website serves to suggest alternative activities to do while waiting for the bus. It was created in
            collaboration with Melvin Chen for our 5D Fundamentals final project.</p>
        <p>View the full website
            <a style="color: dodgerblue;" target="_blank" href="https://amymluo.github.io/bus-activities">here</a>
            or click on any of the buses.</p>


        <p> In our 5D Fundamentals class, we partnered with the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics for the semester to
            re-imagine the space of a bus shelter. For our final project, I wanted to create something that would give
            bus riders a opportunity to interact with bus stops in a non-traditional way. Thus, we decided create a
            suggestions site for activities to do while waiting for the bus.</p>

        <p> While researching ideas for this project, my partner and I came across several websites and articles that
            suggested very practical things to do while waiting for the bus such as make a to-do list, listen to an
            audio book, etc. Our idea was to suggest activities that were so absurd, it'd be unlikely people would
            really do them, but if they did, would actually activate the space in a very interesting way.</p>

        <p> Despite being a computer science major, this was my first experience with HTML/CSS and website development.
            We had a lot of fun playing around with static vs. scrolling elements for our idea pages, figuring out
            image overlays, and positioning elements, albeit with lots of documentation reading, trial and error, and
            Googling. My partner and I also happened to be taking Programming Basics the same semester, so we were able
            to take what we learned about Processing and create an animated bus graphic in Javascript using the p5.js
            library. This gave our website a more cohesive look that portrayed the lighthearted attitude we wanted.</p>
