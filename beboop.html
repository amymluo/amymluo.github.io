		<p> Be-Boop Boolean is a game that was created as a simple, fun way to teach children about boolean logic and
			promote computer science literacy from a young age.
			This game was created in Processing as my Programming Basics final project. The full game below has been
			translated into Javascript using p5.js for web compatibility.</p>

		<p> When brainstorming ideas for this project, I knew I wanted to create a game because I had so much fun
            creating my other game in Processing, <a href="hcs.html" style="color: dodgerblue;"> Hungry College Student </a>.
            I was inspired by the Minecraft Hour of Code, CodeAcademy, and similar CS-related teaching tools. </p>

        <p> Understanding computer science is becoming an increasing important skill in our age of technology, and is
            something I personally wish I'd been exposed to at a younger age. Originally, I wanted to cover all of the
            basic concepts of computer science such as data types, variables, for loops, and arrays, but I realized this
            was too broad of a spectrum and wouldn't allow for in-depth understanding of any topic.</p>

        <p> I chose to focus on boolean logic because it is the underlying concept in most programs and the key to more
            complex ideas in computer science. Boolean logic was also a topic that could be clearly portrayed in a visual
            format with circuits. </p>

        <p> Stuff about the prototype and two views.</p>

        <p> Thinking back to early classes, boolean logic was often taught with visualizing the operators as gates and
            circuits. This idea made robots the perfect characters for my game,
            as well as my personal bias towards robots. For inspiration I looked at Machinarium, Mr. Hublot, and even
            Animal Crossing for their character style and environment. I also decided to make the player more feminine in design and
            color scheme, a subtle show of support for women in tech! </p>
